        <h1>Fist of all, I want to apologize for this website having its rough spots. I underestimated the amout of work behing this and I will definitely continue working on it in my free time. I had to make a lot of compromises on my way, and I wish I had more time, but for now, this has to be it. I hope you can still enjoy this website and I hope, that it will help you, to solve the rubiks cube, since I at least put 100s hours of work into this project... Oh, and also sorry for the terrible spelling, I partially worked on this at like 3 AM... <a href="html/start.html">[Start]</a></h1>
